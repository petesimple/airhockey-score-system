## [1.7.3] â€“ 2025-05-13
### ðŸ§  Enhancements
- Added logic to **suppress the "Between Games" timer** if the match is already won (either by point logic or via confetti trigger).
- Ensures no awkward "Next Game" countdown appears when there's literally no next game to be played. ðŸ˜…
- Refined `scorePoint()` logic to pre-check if the **final game is about to be won** and cancel in-between countdown accordingly.

### âœ… Behavior Fixes
- `clearBetweenGamesTimer()` is now more strictly enforced at match end.
- Ensures match-end UI is clean and doesn't leave lingering timers post-confetti.
- Handles edge case where players hit 7 in final game but haven't clicked "Next Game" yet.

### ðŸª„ UI / UX Polish
- Match-end scenario now feels tighter and more logical, especially during livestreams or recaps.
- No timer countdown distracting viewers when the match is already over.
