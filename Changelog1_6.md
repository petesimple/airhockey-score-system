# Changelog

## [1.6] – Skunk Edition 🦨
### Released: 2025-05-08

**New Features**
- 🎯 **Skinny Scoreboard Pips**: Added visual game pips next to each player's name in the skinny scoreboard:
  - `●` = game won
  - `○` = game lost
  - `🦨` = skunked (lost 0–7)
- ✨ **Dynamic Pips** update automatically after each game and reflect the current game history in real-time.

**UI Improvements**
- Winner names still glow yellow as before, but pips now offer cleaner at-a-glance match tracking.
- Compact summary formatting remains below the scoreboard with updated spacing.

**Misc**
- Version label updated to `ver1.6 – (skunk)`
- Skunk detection now fully integrated in skinny scoreboard only (not full scoreboard for clarity).
